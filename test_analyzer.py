# --- NEW Black Hat Level Scenarios ---

# Test Case 5: The "Personal Email & Brand Spoof Combo"
# An attacker spoofs a known personal contact (bhujbalsai@gmail.com) and uses the name of a trusted brand (Gemini)
# to create a highly convincing lure. The technical failure (spf=fail) is the primary giveaway that a sophisticated
# AI should catch immediately, despite the compelling social context.

# This is a geo-targeted attack that uses a well-known Indian bank (HDFC) and references a real service (NetBanking).

# "high-value transaction" is a powerful psychological trigger.

# Test Case 7: The "OpenAI Security Scare"
# This attack leverages the authority and technical nature of OpenAI. It uses a subdomain lure
# (security.accounts.openai.net) that looks extremely plausible. The mention of "unusual API activity from a foreign IP"
# is designed to panic a developer or user into immediate action.
