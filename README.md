# 🛡️ Guardian AI: Real-time Cross-Channel Threat Detection

Guardian AI is an intelligent security platform designed to protect users from sophisticated, coordinated social engineering attacks by analyzing voice and email communications in real-time. By correlating threats across multiple channels, it provides a unified defense against phishing, vishing (voice phishing), and deepfake-based scams.

## 🎯 The Problem

Traditional security tools operate in silos. They might scan an email or block a known spam number, but they fail to detect coordinated attacks that span multiple channels.  
Scammers exploit this gap by sending a convincing phishing email and following up with a fraudulent call to create urgency and manipulate their victims. **Guardian AI bridges this security gap.**

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔊 Real-time Voice Analysis
- 🗣️ **Antispoof Audio Detection** – Detects synthetic voice generation in audio streams.  
- 🔎 **Scam Intent Analysis** – Uses NLP to identify scam-related keywords and phrases.  
- 📞 **Heuristic Engine** – Verifies caller identity using geographical and historical data.  

### 📧 Advanced Email Security
- 📧 **Header Authentication** – Validates `DMARC`, `SPF`, and `DKIM` records.  
- ✍️ **Authorship Verification** – Compares writing style with known sender style.  
- 🔗 **Phishing Content Detection** – Uses `RoBERTa` to detect malicious intent and links.  

### 🧠 Cross-Channel Fusion Engine
- Correlates **voice + email** threat signals in real-time.  
- Boosts risk score if related threats appear across channels.  
- Generates a single **Fused Risk Score** for ongoing interactions.  

### 📊 Intuitive Threat Dashboard
- Centralized live feed of active threats.  
- Clear, actionable recommendations (e.g., **“ACTION REQUIRED: HANG UP NOW”**).

## 🛠️ System Architecture

Guardian AI is built on a **modern, scalable microservices architecture** designed for high throughput and low latency.

1. **Data Ingestion** – User device sends encrypted audio/text via API Gateway.  
2. **Job Processing** – Asynchronous job queue ensures resilience and scalability.  
3. **AI Processing Services**:  
   - 🎙️ **Voice AI Service** – Audio processing, deepfake detection, ASR.  
   - 📄 **Text AI Service** – Email parsing, header analysis, phishing detection.  
4. **Decision & Notification** –  
   - Fusion Engine correlates scores and finalizes risk decisions.  
   - WebSocket server pushes live alerts to dashboard.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the full Guardian AI platform:

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/guardian-ai.git
cd guardian-ai
```

### 2️⃣ Run the Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

### 3️⃣ Run the Backend Services
In separate terminals, start the services:

**Voice Service:**
```bash
cd ../voice
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --port 8001
```

**Email Service:**
```bash
cd ../email
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --port 8002
```

*(Note: Fusion Engine + WebSocket server should also be run as additional services.)*
